Welcome to my site ðŸ‘‹. This is my place on the web to share thoughts, journal about some fun projects, and tell stories.

I've had a couple false starts while trying to become a regular writer on the web. But this is as close as I've come in
a very long time. I think that's because I was never really happy with the technology choices I had to quickly get a
site running. Years ago, I saw a talk at a conference about the IndieWeb and [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) which
resonated with me. Since then, I knew I didn't want all my writing to be on third-party websites (e.g. Medium, Blogger,
Tumblr, etc.). I started a blog by deploying the [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) open source project on a hosted
server. But ðŸ˜© PHP - it wasn't very fun to work on. I'm a big fan of working in JavaScript, so when the
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) platform came out, I tried again. Despite it being an open source project, I felt like it
limited my ability to change much without making a serious investment in learning the codebase.

**Update (April 27, 2021)**: The next paragraph is out of date. I've since transitioned to using Next.js and I love it!
I'll make a more meaningful update to this post soon.

I'm doing something different this time. I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to build the site and hosting it
on [Now by Zeit](https://zeit.co/home). Gatsby starts small, and allows me to be intentional about the parts I want to
add over time. It also lets me flex my programming muscles with a more modern set of technologies: React, GraphQL, and
TypeScript. Now is extremely well-designed and has the best combination of simplicity, power, and price that I've found.
I feel pretty good about this. So good, in fact, that I've shared [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/aoberoi/me).

There's plenty of work to do on this site, but I hope you'll stick around and come visit again. Thanks for stopping by.
